Data were good quality, they only needed a headcrop to remove initial base bias.

Lambda conversion looks good, about 1% spike in each sample with an average conversion of 0.4%.

Alignment isn't great but nothing to be done, average of 48%.

Deduplication also looks good with 24% average duplicates.
